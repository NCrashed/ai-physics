I want you to output Rust code. The program is a game that renders with SDL2 library. The player is small red circle that can be moved by WASD input by player. There are 10 small blue circles. They are affected by gravity and collides with each other with momentum conservation. The screen edges are solid walls for blue circles. Player adds impulse to blue circles when collides with them.
